# Hi there 👋!

## Data Science

My name is Martina, I am a data scientist by profession and a general data lover - I have always been fascinated by the idea of extracting quantitative information, challenge assumptions, prove facts. Data science is sometimes a difficult proposition, I like helping others enter the field or understand how to use data to solve a problem, I enjoy sharing what I have learned myself with people.

Because I love public speaking (on technical and non-technical topics, I've done a bunch of talks, you can see them [here](https://github.com/martinapugliese/martinapugliese/blob/main/speaking.md). 

## Science

I come from science, having done some academic research (in Physics, but I applied methods of statistical mechanics/complex systems to linguistics, studying the evolution of natural language), you can see my publications [here](https://github.com/martinapugliese/martinapugliese/blob/main/scientific_publications.md).

## Projects

- 🎨 I curate a newsletter about data storytelling, with hand-drawn data vizzes and stories around them, you can find it [here](https://doodlingdata.substack.com/)
- 🔊 I spoke about data in various events, usually around Scotland - list [here](https://github.com/martinapugliese/martinapugliese/blob/main/speaking.md)
- I enjoy mentoring people about data (both technically and not)
