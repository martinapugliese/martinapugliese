# Hi there 👋!

## Data Science

I work in data/Machine Learning/AI and I'm a general data lover - I have always been fascinated by the idea of extracting quantitative information, challenge assumptions, prove facts. I also have a keen interest in the ethical application of algorithmic systems. 

## Science

I come from science, having done some academic research in Physics, applying methods of statistical mechanics/complex systems to Linguistics - I studied the evolution of natural language. You can see my publications [here](https://github.com/martinapugliese/martinapugliese/blob/main/scientific_publications.md).
