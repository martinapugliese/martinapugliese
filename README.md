# Hi there 👋!

## Data Science

My name is Martina, I am a data scientist by profession and a general data lover - I have always been fascinated by the idea of extracting quantitative information, challenge assumptions, prove facts. I work in Machine Learning/AI and have a keen interest in the ethical application of algorithmic systems. 

## Science

I come from science, having done some academic research (in Physics, but I applied methods of statistical mechanics/complex systems to Linguistics, studying the evolution of natural language), you can see my publications [here](https://github.com/martinapugliese/martinapugliese/blob/main/scientific_publications.md).

## Projects

- 🎨 I curate a newsletter about data storytelling, with hand-drawn data vizzes and stories around them, you can find it [here](https://buttondown.email/martinapugliese)
- 🔊 I usually speak about data in various events - list of my talks [here](https://github.com/martinapugliese/martinapugliese/blob/main/speaking.md)
- 👥 I enjoy mentoring people about data (both technically and not)
- 🔥 I am all about open and accessible data - I volunteer with [OnData](https://github.com/ondata)

- 💬 Ask me all about entering data science, what does it mean to be a DS, etc. - I'm happy to provide guidance
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinapugliese/) is probably the best place, but you can find me around on other socials too.
