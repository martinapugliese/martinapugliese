# Speaking

I really enjoy public speaking, and in fact I may occasionally talk about it here on the blog. Throughout the years, I've been speaking at several events, from academic to tech ones, from formal events to informal gatherings. If you want to have a chat about speaking at some event, just pop me a message. I'm also available for tips and help about speaking in public if you want to chat about it.

## Talks I've given

* *Is Data Science a mature field yet? A debate over the evolution of this field*, Edinburgh, May 2020 - this was a round table I co-organised and chaired, it was a discussion with various people involved in data where we chatted about the path data science has gone through
